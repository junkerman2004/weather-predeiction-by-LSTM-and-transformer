# Heating Prediction Model

## Overview
This project presents a predictive model that estimates future heating requirements based on recent weather conditions, heating, wind direction, engineering metrics, and sunlight exposure. Utilizing data from the past few days, the model forecasts the heating load for the upcoming week.

## Key Features
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines the strengths of Transformer and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for robust forecasting.
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Integrates various environmental and operational data to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Scalability**: Designed to adapt to different heating systems and geographic locations.

## Installation
To set up the Heating Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heating-prediction-model.git
Install required packages:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your environment (if necessary).
Usage
To use the Heating Prediction Model, execute the following commands:

Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd heating-prediction-model
Run the prediction script:
bash
python predict.py
View the results in the generated output file.
