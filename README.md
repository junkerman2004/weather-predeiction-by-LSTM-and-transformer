Heating Load Prediction using LSTM and Transform-based Methods
Overview
This project aims to predict the heating load for the following week based on various factors such as historical weather conditions, heating supply, wind direction, engineering indices, and sunshine duration. We have implemented two distinct approaches:

LSTM-based Prediction: Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
Transform-based Prediction: Utilizing transformation techniques such as normalization and feature engineering combined with traditional machine learning algorithms.
The goal is to compare the performance of these two methods and identify which one provides more accurate and reliable predictions.

Methods
LSTM-based Prediction
Data Preprocessing:
Normalize and scale the data.
Create sequences of input features and corresponding heating load values.
Model Building:
Define an LSTM network architecture.
Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer.
Training:
Train the LSTM model on the training data.
Use validation data to monitor for overfitting and adjust hyperparameters.
Prediction:
Make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
Transform-based Prediction
Data Preprocessing:
Apply normalization and scaling.
Engineer new features if necessary.
Model Building:
Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
Train the model on the preprocessed data.
Prediction:
Make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors without considering their direction.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors).
R² Score: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Results
The results are stored in the results/ directory. Each model's predictions and evaluation metrics are saved in separate CSV files. The evaluation_metrics.csv file provides a comparison of the two methods based on the selected metrics.
